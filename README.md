## Description

I wanted to create and application that allows users to communicate with each other in real-time and for them to have and individual login.
This app allows users to post a title and and text for a blog entry. It also allows other users to reply to a users entry. I learned how to use sequelize
and bcrypt to hash a login for an individual user. I learned how to store user and other other important information in a sql database.

When the use goes to the page they are greeted with a homepage with a navigation bar that has a home and login button. When the use clicks on the login
button they are sent to a sign in and sign up page where the user can be create an account or sign into their created account. When the user signs in they 
are directed to a personal homepage
